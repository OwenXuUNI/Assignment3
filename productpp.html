            <h2>Descriptions and Specs</h2>
            <p>This heavy duty, dual zone, fridge/freezer is built to last. Packed with features and enough space for extended remote trips, this model includes a separate lid for the fridge and freezer zones and runs on a reliable LG compressor. Suitable for 12 or 24 volt systems, the unit features a three-stage low-battery cut-out to prevent a flat or damaged vehicle battery. Other features include digital temperature controls, and low energy consumption. Thanks to the high density foam insulation, the fridge can provide temperatures down to -20Â°C. Finished in a sleek, durable stainless steel case, it includes sturdy handles for easy lifting. The unit is supplied with a power lead that plugs into a vehicle cigarette lighter socket and includes a Mains Power Adapter so the fridge can be run from a standard 240 volt power point. </p>
